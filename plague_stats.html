	<h1>
		First pandemic of plague
	</h1>
	<ul>
		<li>The <b>Black Death</b>, also known as the <b>Pestilence</b> and the <b>Plague</b>, was the most fatal pandemic recorded in human history, resulting in the deaths of up to 75–200 million people in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurasia">Eurasia</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Africa">North Africa</a>, peaking in Europe from 1347 to 1351.</li>
		<li>
			The Black Death was the second disaster affecting Europe during the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crisis_of_the_Late_Middle_Ages">Late Middle Ages</a> (the first one being the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Famine_of_1315%E2%80%931317">Great Famine</a>) and is estimated to have killed 30% to 60% of Europe's population.
		</li>
		<li>
			In total, the plague may have reduced the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_population">world population</a> from an estimated 475 million to 350–375 million in the 14th century.
		</li>
		<li>
			It killed some 75 to 200 million people in Eurasia.
		</li>
		<li>
			The mortality rate of the Black Death in the 14th century was far greater than the worst 20th-century outbreaks of Y. pestis plague, which occurred in India and killed as much as 3% of the population of certain cities.
		</li>
		<li>
			According to medieval historian <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Daileader">Philip Daileader</a>, it is likely that over four years, 45–50% of the European population died of the plague.
		</li>
		<li>
			Half of Paris' population of 100,000 people died. In Italy, the population of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florence">Florence</a> was reduced from 110,000–120,000 inhabitants in 1338 down to 50,000 in 1351.
		</li>
		<li>
			At least 60% of the population of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamburg">Hamburg and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bremen">Bremen</a> perished, and a similar percentage of Londoners may have died from the disease as well, with a death toll of approximately 62,000 between 1346 and 1353.
		</li>
	</ul><br>
	<h1>Second plague pandemic</h1>
	<p>
		The plague repeatedly returned to haunt Europe and the Mediterranean throughout the 14th to 17th centuries. According to Biraben, the plague was present somewhere in Europe in every year between 1346 and 1671. (Note that some researchers have cautions about the uncritical use of Biraben's data.)<br>
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>According to historian Geoffrey Parker, "<b>France alone lost almost a million people</b> to the plague in the epidemic of 1628–31.</li>
		<li>In the first half of the 17th century, a plague claimed some 1.7 million victims in Italy.</li>
		<li>
			More than 1.25 million deaths resulted from the extreme incidence of plague in 17th-century Spain.
		</li>
		<li>
			Plague repeatedly struck the cities of North Africa. Algiers lost 30,000–50,000 inhabitants to it in 1620–1621.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<h1>Third plague pandemic</h1>
	<p>
		The third plague pandemic (1855–1859) started in China in the mid-19th century, spreading to all inhabited continents and <b>killing 10 million people in India alone</b>. Twelve plague outbreaks in Australia between 1900 and 1925 resulted in well over 1,000 deaths, chiefly in Sydney. This led to the establishment of a Public Health Department there which undertook some leading-edge research on plague transmission from rat fleas to humans via the bacillus <i>Yersinia pestis</i>.
	</p>
	<h1>
		Plague around the world
	</h1>
	<p>
		Epidemics of plague killed millions of people (about one-quarter of the population) in Europe during the Middle Ages. It came to be known as the "black death."<br>
	</p>
	<p>
		Today the risk of developing plague is quite low, with only <a href="http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs267/en/">3,248 cases and 584 deaths</a> reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) from 2010 to 2015.
	</p>
	<p>
		Outbreaks are generally associated with infested rats and fleas in the home. Crowded living conditions and bad sanitation also increase the risk of plague.<br>
	</p>
	<p>
		Today, most human cases of the plague occur in Africa though they do appear elsewhere. The countries in which the plague is most common are Madagascar, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and Peru.<br>
	</p>
	<p>
		The plague is rare in the United States, but the disease is <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/plague/maps/index.html">still sometimes found</a> in the rural southwest and, in particular, in Arizona, Colorado, and New Mexico. The last epidemic of plague in the United States occurred in 1924 to 1925 in Los Angeles.<br>
	</p>
	<p>
		In the United States, reported <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/plague/maps/">cases</a> average seven per year. Most have been in the form of the bubonic plague. There hasn’t been a case of person-to-person transmission of the plague in U.S. urban areas since 1924.<br>
