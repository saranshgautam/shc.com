	<h1>Some of the leading figures of pneumonia</h1>
	<p>
		Pneumonia is the leading infectious killer of children under five years of age.
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>In 2015 alone, more than 900,000 children died from this preventable and treatable illness, accounting for 16% of under-five child mortality worldwide, 3% of which are newborns.</li>
		<li>In 2008, there were an estimated 203,000 deaths due to Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) and 541,000 deaths due to Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) in children under five.2</li>
		<li>Scaling up coverage of vaccines against Hib and pneumococcus in the world’s 73 poorest countries (2011-2020) would avert $51 billion dollars in treatment costs and productivity losses.</li>
		<li>This increase in vaccine coverage would also save 2.9 million lives and prevent 52 million cases of illness.</li>
