		How to prevent plague
	</h1>
	<p>
		Keeping the rodent population under control in your home, workplace, and recreation areas can greatly reduce your risk of getting the bacteria that causes plague. Keep your home free from stacks of cluttered firewood or piles of rock, brush, or other debris that could attract rodents.<br>
	</p>
	<p>
		Protect your pets from fleas using flea control products. Pets that roam freely outdoors may be more likely to come into contact with plague-infected fleas or animals.<br>
	</p>
	<p>
		If you live in an area where the plague is known to occur, the CDC recommends not allowing pets that roam freely outside to sleep in your bed. If your pet becomes sick, seek care from a veterinarian right away.<br>
	</p>
	<p>
		Use insect repellent products or natural insect repellants (like <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4173961/">oil of lemon eucalyptus</a>) when spending time outdoors.<br>
	</p>
	<p>
		If you have been exposed to fleas during a plague outbreak, visit your doctor immediately so your concerns can be addressed quickly.<br>
	</p>
	<p>
		There is currently no commercially available vaccine against plague in the United States.<br>
	</p>

		What to do if you think you might have the plague
	</h1>
	<p>
		Plague is a life-threatening disease. If you have been exposed to rodents or fleas, or if you have visited a region where plague is known to occur, and you develop symptoms of plague, contact your doctor immediately:<br>
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Be prepared to tell your doctor about any recent travel locations and dates.</li>
		<li>Make a list of all over-the-counter medications, supplements, and prescription drugs you take.</li>
		<li>Make a list of people who have had close contact with you.</li>
		<li>Tell your doctor about all your symptoms and when they first appeared.</li>
	</ul><br>
	<p>
		When you visit the doctor, emergency room, or anywhere else where others are present, wear a surgical mask to prevent the spread of the disease.
