	<h1>Overview</h1>
	<p>
		Pneumonia is an infection in one or both <a href="https://www.healthline.com/human-body-maps/lung">lungs</a>. Bacteria, viruses, and fungi cause it.
		The infection causes inflammation in the air sacs in your lungs, which are called <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/alveoli-function">alveoli</a>. The alveoli fill with fluid or pus, making it difficult to breathe.
		Read on to learn more about pneumonia and how to treat it.<br>
	</p>
	<h1>
		Is pneumonia contagious?
	</h1>
	<p>
		The germs that cause pneumonia are <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/is-pneumonia-contagious">contagious. This means they can spread from person to person.<br>
	</p>
	<p>
		Both <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/viral-pneumonia">viral</a> and <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/bacterial-pneumonia">bacterial</a> pneumonia can spread to others through inhalation of airborne droplets from a sneeze or cough. You can also get these types of pneumonia by coming into contact with surfaces or objects that are contaminated with pneumonia-causing bacteria or viruses.<br>
	</p>
	<p>
		You can contract fungal pneumonia from the environment. However, it doesn’t spread from person to person.<br>
	</p>
	<h1>
		Causes of pneumonia
	</h1>
	<p>
		There are several types of infectious agents that can cause pneumonia.<br>
	</p>
	<h2>Bacterial pneumonia</h2>
	<p>
		The most common cause of <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/bacterial-pneumonia">bacterial pneumonia</a> is Streptococcus pneumoniae. Other causes include:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/mycoplasma-pneumonia">Mycoplasma pneumoniae</a></li>
		<li><i>Haemophilus influenzae</i></li>
		<li><a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/legionnaires-disease">Legionella pneumophila</a></li>
	</ul><br>
	<h2>Viral pneumonia</h2>
	<p>
		Respiratory viruses are often the cause of pneumonia. Some examples include:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>influenza (<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/cold-flu/flu">flu</a>)</li>
		<li><a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/respiratory-syncytial-virus-rsv">respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)</a></li>
		<li><a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/common-cold-causes">rhinoviruses</a> (common cold)</li>
	</ul><br>
	<p>
		<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/viral-pneumonia">Viral pneumonia</a> is usually milder and can improve in one to three weeks without treatment.<br>
	</p>
	<h2>Fungal pneumonia</h2>
	<p>
		Fungi from soil or bird droppings can cause pneumonia. They most often cause pneumonia in people with <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/pneumonia-weakened-immune-system">weakened immune systems</a>. Examples of fungi that can cause pneumonia include:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li><i>Pneumocystis jirovecii</i></li>
		<li><i>Cryptococcus species</i></li>
		<li><a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/histoplasmosis">Histoplasmosis</a> species</li>
	</ul><br>
	<h1>
		Types of pneumonia
	</h1>
	<p>
		Pneumonia can also be classified according to where or how it was acquired.<br>
	</p>
	<h2>
		Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP)
	</h2>
	<p>
		This type of bacterial pneumonia is acquired during a hospital stay. It can be more serious than other types, as the bacteria involved may be more <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health-news/antibiotic-resistance-series-072414">resistant to antibiotics</a>.<br>
	</p>
	<h2>
		Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP)
	</h2>
	<p>
		<b>Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP)</b> refers to pneumonia that’s acquired outside of a medical or institutional setting.<br>
	</p>
	<h2>
		Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)
	</h2>
	<p>
		When people who are using a ventilator get pneumonia, it’s called VAP.<br>
	</p>
	<h2>
		Aspiration pneumonia
	</h2>
	<p>
		<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/aspiration-pneumonia">Aspiration pneumonia</a> happens when you inhale bacteria into your lungs from food, drink, or saliva. This type is more likely to occur if you have a swallowing problem or if you’re too sedate from the use of medications, alcohol, or other drugs.<br>
	</p>
	<h1>
		Pneumonia risk factors
	</h1>
	<p>
		Anyone can get pneumonia, but certain groups do have a higher risk. These groups include:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>infants from birth to 2 years old</li>
		<li>people ages 65 years and older</li>
		<li>people with weakened immune systems because of disease or use of medications, such as steroids or certain cancer drugs</li>
		<li>people with certain chronic medical conditions, such as <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/asthma">asthma</a>, <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/cystic-fibrosis">cystic fibrosis</a>, <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/diabetes">diabetes</a>, or <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/heart-failure">heart failure</a></li>
		<li>people who’ve recently had a respiratory infection, such as a <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/common-cold-causes">cold</a> or the <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/cold-flu/flu">flu</a></li>
		<li>people who’ve been recently or are currently hospitalized, particularly if they were or are on a ventilator</li>
		<li>people who’ve had a <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/stroke-types">stroke</a>, have problems swallowing, or have a condition that causes immobility</li>
		<li>people who smoke, use certain types of drugs, or drink excessive amounts of alcohol</li>
		<li>people who’ve been exposed to lung irritants, such as pollution, fumes, and certain chemicals</li>
	</ul>
