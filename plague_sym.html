		Signs and symptoms of the plague
	</h1>
	<p>
		People infected with the plague usually develop flu-like symptoms two to six days after infection. There are other symptoms that can help distinguish the three forms of the plague.<br>
	</p>
	<h2>Bubonic plague symptoms</h2>
	<p>
		Symptoms of bubonic plague generally appear within two to six days of infection. They include:
	</p>
	<ul>

		<li>headache</li>
		<li>muscle pain</li>
		<li>general weakness</li>
		<li>seizure</li>
	</ul><br>
	<p>
		You may also experience painful, swollen lymph glands, called buboes. These typically appear in the groin, armpits, neck, or site of the insect bite or scratch. The buboes are what give bubonic plague its name.<br>
	</p>
	<h2>
