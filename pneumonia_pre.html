		Pneumonia prevention
	</h1>
	<p>
		In many cases, pneumonia can be prevented.<br>
	</p>
	<h2>
		Vaccination
	</h2>
	<p>
		The first line of defense against pneumonia is to get vaccinated. There are several vaccines that can help prevent pneumonia.<br>
	</p>
	<p><b>Prevnar 13 and Pneumovax 23</b><br></p>
	<p>
		These two pneumonia vaccines help protect against pneumonia and <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/meningitis-pneumococcal">meningitis</a> caused by pneumococcal bacteria. Your doctor can tell you which one might be better for you.<br>
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Prevnar 13</b> is effective against 13 types of pneumococcal bacteria. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/pneumo/public/index.html">recommends</a> this vaccine for:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>children under the age of 2</li>
		<li>adults ages 65 years and older</li>
		<li>people between ages 2 and 64 years with chronic conditions that increase their risk for pneumonia</li>
	</ul><br>
	<p>
		<b>Pneumovax 23</b> is effective against 23 types of pneumococcal bacteria. The CDC <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/pneumo/public/index.html">recommends</a> it for:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>adults ages 65 years and older</li>
		<li>adults ages 19 to 64 years who smoke</li>
		<li>people between ages 2 and 64 years with chronic conditions that increase their risk for pneumonia</li>
	</ul><br>
	<p>
		<b>Flu vaccine</b><br>
	</p>
	<p>
		Pneumonia can often be a complication of the flu, so be sure to also get an annual <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/flu-shot-pros-and-cons">flu shot</a>. The CDC <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/prevent/keyfacts.htm">recommends</a> that everyone ages 6 months and older get vaccinated, particularly those who may be at risk for flu complications.<br>
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Hib vaccine</b><br>
	</p>
	<p>
		This vaccine protects against <i>Haemophilus influenzae</i> type b (Hib), a type of bacteria that can cause pneumonia and meningitis. The CDC <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/hib/index.html">recommends</a> this vaccine for:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>all children under 5 years old</li>
		<li>unvaccinated older children or adults who have certain health conditions</li>
		<li>individuals who’ve gotten a bone marrow transplant</li>
	</ul><br>
	<p>
		According to the <a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health-topics/pneumonia">National Institutes of Health (NIH)</a>, pneumonia vaccines won’t prevent all cases of the condition. But if you’re vaccinated, you’re likely to have a milder and shorter illness as well as a lower risk for complications.<br>

	</h2>
	<p>
		In addition to vaccination, there are other things you can to avoid pneumonia:
	</p>
	<ul>
